# YOLO11: Advanced Real-Time Object Detection and More
 ## Overview
 YOLO11 is the latest iteration in the "You Only Look Once" series, offering cutting-edge performance in real-time object detection, instance segmentation, image classification, pose estimation, 
 and oriented object detection. Building upon the success of its predecessors, YOLO11 introduces significant architectural enhancements and optimized training methodologies, making it a versatile tool for a wide range of computer vision applications.
 ## Key Features
 1. Enhanced Feature Extraction: Utilizes an improved backbone and neck architecture to bolster feature extraction capabilities, leading to more precise object detection and complex task performance.
 2. Optimized Efficiency and Speed: Incorporates refined architectural designs and training pipelines, delivering faster processing speeds while maintaining a balance between accuracy and performance.
 3. Higher Accuracy with Fewer Parameters: Achieves greater mean Average Precision (mAP) on the COCO dataset with fewer parameters compared to previous versions, enhancing computational efficiency without compromising accuracy.
 4. Versatile Deployment: Designed for seamless integration across various environments, including edge devices, cloud platforms, and systems equipped with NVIDIA GPUs.
 5. Support for Multiple Tasks: Extends beyond object detection to include instance segmentation, image classification, pose estimation, and oriented object detection, catering to diverse computer vision challenges.

 ## The code
 I have written a basic training and prediction using YOLO11 model. It is using the basic Yolo11n model, which is faster and somewhat accurate. Other powerful models can be used which will require more gpu power and memory, such as Yolo11x. Any image can be given to the model 
 for prediction, you can put your images inside the "images" folder. Moreover it can also detect using webcam. To use it you have to give collab access to your webcam and just run the code. The webcam will capture an image as "captured_image.jpg", which then can be fed to the model
 for predction.
 Though it is a simple usage of a model, it is a very exciting project. It can inspire to tweak Yolo11n model to make it a little bit accurate which will be useful to run in systems with low cpu and gpu power. 
 P.S. I will soon start working on making it efficient and accurate..


 ## Installation
 To install YOLO11, ensure you have Python 3.8 or later and run:
 ```python
 pip install ultralytics
 ```
 ## Quick Train
 ```python
 from ultralytics import YOLO

# Load a pretrained YOLO11 model
model = YOLO('yolo11n.pt')

# Perform inference on an image
results = model('path/to/your/image.jpg')

# Display the results
results.show()
```
 For command-line interface (CLI) usage:
 ```python
 yolo detect model=yolo11n.pt source='path/to/your/image.jpg'
 ```

 ## Training
 To train YOLO11 we can use pretrained model such as coco.yaml or we can use our own custom dataset:
 1. Prepare your dataset following the YOLO Format.
 2. Create a data configuration file, e.g., data.yaml.
 3. Run the command:
 ```python
 yolo train model=yolo11n.pt data=data.yaml epochs=100 imgsz=640
 ```
